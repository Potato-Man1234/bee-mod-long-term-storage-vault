This contain the beepacks that are all over the place in the open web,  most of them found from #ucp-discussion.
The files being up to date with their highest version is not guaranteed

to download one of the files just click on it and click "view raw"

If you are to add to the vault the extension of your file should be .bee_pack if github would normally accept the size of it,  otherwise use .zip to use github LFS if it exceeds that limit
